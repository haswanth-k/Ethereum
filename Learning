Dapps (Decentralized apps)= User Interface + Smart Contract
Bitcoin and Ethereum uses blockchain technology and Bitcoin main used for digital currency
Ethereum currency= Ether
Anyone can send ether to anyone no one can block anyone, real identity is hidden
transaction charges apply because of computing and mining
two types of accounts EOA(externally owned account) and contract account(doesn't require private and public key)
EOA only used for sending ether or digital tokens and contracts not able to contracts because only EOA can initiate contracts
EOA has private key and public key, using elliptic curve public key will be created.
Ethereum network composed of nodes, after user initiated transaction it sends to each node, collection of trans. called block.
After creating block it will solve a puzzle for validating the node and adds to the ethereum blockchain and passes through each node at last will create a Ethers
For running transaction we need gas
max gasfee= gasprice(price offering) * gas limit(max units you are willing to spend)
totaltransaction fee = (base fee(minimum gas price)+ tip(bribe))* gas limit
refund = maxfeepergas - actual fee
refund = maxfeepergas -(base fee)+ tip
wallets are software that allows users to connect to ethereum network
One network is completely isolated from different network and it don't have idea about assets of others
We can create another wallet account like deterministic account for testing purposes
